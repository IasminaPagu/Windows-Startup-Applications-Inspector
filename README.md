# Windows Startup Applications Inspector


This is a command-line application for Windows that displays the list of user-level applications that are automatically launched by the operating system at startup, after the user logs into the system.

The application scans and uses all relevant Registry keys where such information can be found, both for the current user and the system.

Each detected startup application is analyzed individually in terms of its function, its role in the system, and potential security risks it may pose.

Additionally, the program displays the name of the computer on which it is being executed.
